description: "Generate or edit raster images when the task benefits from AI-created bitmap visuals such as photos, illustrations, textures, sprites, mockups, or transparent-background cutouts. Use when Codex should create a brand-new image, transform an existing image, or derive visual variants from references, and the output should be a bitmap asset rather than repo-native code or vector. Do not use when the task is better handled by editing existing SVG/vector/code-native assets, extending an established icon or logo system, or building the visual directly in HTML/CSS/canvas."

# Image Generation Skill

Generates or edits images for the current project (for example website assets, game assets, UI mockups, product mockups, wireframes, logo design, photorealistic images, or infographics).

## Top-level modes and rules

Choose the execution path from the user's request and the available API:

- **OpenAI-compatible Images API:** use `generate_image` for generation or edits. Direct calls display the result in the conversation. In `tool_exec`, call `generatedImage(result.images[0])` on the returned result to display it. When the user supplies an external API in the conversation, pass its base URL, model and credential as applicable. No separate image-provider setup is required.
- **Another API or local workflow:** use its documented interface and the available tools. The bundled `scripts/image_gen.py` is an OpenAI GPT Image CLI, not a universal adapter. Determine the appropriate interface from the user's information and available documentation.

The bundled CLI exposes three subcommands:

- `generate`
- `edit`
- `generate-batch`

Rules:
- Use `generate_image` when the selected API supports the OpenAI Images contract. API details can be supplied in an ordinary user message; do not require a separate settings form.
- Image generation can take minutes. In `tool_exec`, use `yield_time_ms: 120000` for the initial call; if it returns a running cell ID, wait for that cell with `tool_wait` before reporting the result. Forward the selected image with `generatedImage(result.images[0])`, and do not print its base64 data with `text()`.
- In code mode, check `result.is_error` before publishing: return the actual error with `text(result.content)` on failure, and call `generatedImage(result.images[0])` on success.
- Do not send a generation request merely to check credentials or API capabilities. Report a real failure rather than claiming an image exists.
- For transparent images, request a transparent background when the selected API supports it and preserve the alpha.
- Do not silently switch the user's selected provider or model.
- For a different API contract, use its documentation and existing tools. Save the result in the workspace. When `tool_exec` is available, forward the saved image through the same generated-image projection:
  ```js
  const result = await tools.read_file({file_path: "/absolute/workspace/path/image.png"});
  generatedImage(result.images[0]);
  ```
  If that execution surface is unavailable, render the saved image in the answer using its absolute path.

Save-path policy:
- If the user names a destination or the image is a project asset, supply a new workspace `output_path` to `generate_image`.
- For preview-only work, the tool's conversation image is sufficient.
- For another API, save a workspace image and use `generatedImage` as above, or a Markdown image when that surface is unavailable.
- Do not overwrite an existing asset unless the user explicitly asked for replacement; otherwise create a sibling versioned filename such as `hero-v2.png` or `item-icon-edited.png`.

Shared prompt guidance for both modes lives in `references/prompting.md` and `references/sample-prompts.md`.

Fallback-only docs/resources for CLI mode:

- `references/image-api.md`
- `references/codex-network.md`
- `scripts/image_gen.py`

## When to use
- Generate a new image (concept art, product shot, cover, website hero)
- Generate a new image using one or more reference images for style, composition, or mood
- Edit an existing image (inpainting, lighting or weather transformations, background replacement, object removal, compositing, transparent background)
- Produce many assets or variants for one task

## When not to use
- Extending or matching an existing SVG/vector icon set, logo system, or illustration library inside the repo
- Creating simple shapes, diagrams, wireframes, or icons that are better produced directly in SVG, HTML/CSS, or canvas
- Making a small project-local asset edit when the source file already exists in an editable native format
- Any task where the user clearly wants deterministic code-native output instead of a generated bitmap

## Decision tree

Think about two separate questions:

1. **Intent:** is this a new image or an edit of an existing image?
2. **Execution strategy:** is this one asset or many assets/variants?

Intent:
- If the user wants to modify an existing image while preserving parts of it, treat the request as **edit**.
- If the user provides images only as references for style, composition, mood, or subject guidance, treat the request as **generate**.
- If the user provides no images, treat the request as **generate**.

Edit semantics:
- Supply accessible image paths as `input_images`, or use `num_last_images_to_include` for recent conversation images, when the selected API supports edits.
- Use the selected API's own interface for masks or options it requires.
- For edits, preserve invariants aggressively and save non-destructively by default.

Execution strategy:
- Produce distinct assets or variants with one `generate_image` call per requested asset or variant.
- Use the bundled CLI `generate-batch` when it fits the batch request and selected API.
- For many distinct assets, do not use `n` as a substitute for separate prompts. `n` is for variants of one prompt; distinct assets need distinct built-in calls or distinct CLI `generate-batch` jobs.

Assume the user wants a new image unless they clearly ask to change an existing one.

## Workflow
1. Select the image API and execution path from the user's request and available context.
2. Decide the intent: `generate` or `edit`.
3. Decide whether the output is preview-only or meant to be consumed by the current project.
4. Decide the execution strategy: single asset, repeated calls, or a suitable batch workflow.
5. Collect inputs up front: prompt(s), exact text (verbatim), constraints/avoid list, and any input images.
6. For every input image, label its role explicitly:
   - reference image
   - edit target
   - supporting insert/style/compositing input
7. Inspect a local edit target before editing it.
8. If the user asked for a photo, illustration, sprite, product image, banner, or other raster asset, use the selected image-generation workflow. Prefer existing vector assets for code-native graphics.
9. Augment the prompt based on specificity:
   - If the user's prompt is already specific and detailed, normalize it into a clear spec without adding creative requirements.
   - If the user's prompt is generic, add tasteful augmentation only when it materially improves output quality.
10. Use `generate_image` for a compatible Images API, or the chosen API's documented workflow.
11. For transparent-output requests, request a transparent background where supported and preserve the generated alpha channel.
12. Inspect outputs and validate: subject, style, composition, text accuracy, and invariants/avoid items.
13. Iterate with a single targeted change, then re-check.
14. For preview-only work, show the resulting image inline.
15. For project-bound work, save the selected artifact into the workspace and update any consuming code or references.
16. For batches or multi-asset requests, persist every requested deliverable final in the workspace unless the user explicitly asked to keep outputs preview-only. Discarded variants do not need to be kept unless requested.
17. Consult the bundled CLI and API references when they apply to the selected provider.
18. Report the final saved path(s) for workspace-bound assets.

## Transparent image requests

Request a genuinely transparent background from an API that supports it and preserve its alpha.

## Prompt augmentation

Reformat user prompts into a structured, production-oriented spec. Make the user's goal clearer and more actionable, but do not blindly add detail.

Treat this as prompt-shaping guidance, not a closed schema. Use only the lines that help, and add a short extra labeled line when it materially improves clarity.

### Specificity policy

Use the user's prompt specificity to decide how much augmentation is appropriate:

- If the prompt is already specific and detailed, preserve that specificity and only normalize/structure it.
- If the prompt is generic, you may add tasteful augmentation when it will materially improve the result.

Allowed augmentations:
- composition or framing hints
- polish level or intended-use hints
- practical layout guidance
- reasonable scene concreteness that supports the stated request

Not allowed augmentations:
- extra characters or objects that are not implied by the request
- brand names, slogans, palettes, or narrative beats that are not implied
- arbitrary side-specific placement unless the surrounding layout supports it

## Use-case taxonomy (exact slugs)

Classify each request into one of these buckets and keep the slug consistent across prompts and references.

Generate:
- photorealistic-natural — candid/editorial lifestyle scenes with real texture and natural lighting.
- product-mockup — product/packaging shots, catalog imagery, merch concepts.
- ui-mockup — app/web interface mockups and wireframes; specify the desired fidelity.
- infographic-diagram — diagrams/infographics with structured layout and text.
- scientific-educational — classroom explainers, scientific diagrams, and learning visuals with required labels and accuracy constraints.
- ads-marketing — campaign concepts and ad creatives with audience, brand position, scene, and exact tagline/copy.
- productivity-visual — slide, chart, workflow, and data-heavy business visuals.
- logo-brand — logo/mark exploration, vector-friendly.
- illustration-story — comics, children’s book art, narrative scenes.
- stylized-concept — style-driven concept art, 3D/stylized renders.
- historical-scene — period-accurate/world-knowledge scenes.

Edit:
- text-localization — translate/replace in-image text, preserve layout.
- identity-preserve — try-on, person-in-scene; lock face/body/pose.
- precise-object-edit — remove/replace a specific element (including interior swaps).
- lighting-weather — time-of-day/season/atmosphere changes only.
- background-extraction — transparent background / clean cutout. Request transparency from a supporting API.
- style-transfer — apply reference style while changing subject/scene.
- compositing — multi-image insert/merge with matched lighting/perspective.
- sketch-to-render — drawing/line art to photoreal render.

## Shared prompt schema

Use the following labeled spec as shared prompt scaffolding for both top-level modes:

```text
Use case: <taxonomy slug>
Asset type: <where the asset will be used>
Primary request: <user's main prompt>
Input images: <Image 1: role; Image 2: role> (optional)
Scene/backdrop: <environment>
Subject: <main subject>
Style/medium: <photo/illustration/3D/etc>
Composition/framing: <wide/close/top-down; placement>
Lighting/mood: <lighting + mood>
Color palette: <palette notes>
Materials/textures: <surface details>
Text (verbatim): "<exact text>"
Constraints: <must keep/must avoid>
Avoid: <negative constraints>
```

Notes:
- `Asset type` and `Input images` are prompt scaffolding, not dedicated CLI flags.
- `Scene/backdrop` refers to the visual setting. It is not the same as the fallback CLI `background` parameter, which controls output transparency behavior.
- `generate_image` accepts quality, size and an output path; use the selected API's own interface for other options such as masks or input fidelity.

Augmentation rules:
- Keep it short.
- Add only the details needed to improve the prompt materially.
- For edits, explicitly list invariants (`change only X; keep Y unchanged`).
- If any critical detail is missing and blocks success, ask a question; otherwise proceed.

## Examples

### Generation example (hero image)
```text
Use case: product-mockup
Asset type: landing page hero
Primary request: a minimal hero image of a ceramic coffee mug
Style/medium: clean product photography
Composition/framing: wide composition with usable negative space for page copy if needed
Lighting/mood: soft studio lighting
Constraints: no logos, no text, no watermark
```

### Edit example (invariants)
```text
Use case: precise-object-edit
Asset type: product photo background replacement
Primary request: replace only the background with a warm sunset gradient
Constraints: change only the background; keep the product and its edges unchanged; no text; no watermark
```

## Prompting best practices
- Structure prompt as scene/backdrop -> subject -> details -> constraints.
- Include intended use (ad, UI mock, infographic) to set the mode and polish level.
- Use camera/composition language for photorealism.
- Only use SVG/vector stand-ins when the user explicitly asked for vector output or a non-image placeholder.
- Quote exact text and specify typography + placement.
- For tricky words, spell them letter-by-letter and require verbatim rendering.
- For multi-image inputs, reference images by index and describe how they should be used.
- For edits, repeat invariants every iteration to reduce drift.
- Iterate with single-change follow-ups.
- If the prompt is generic, add only the extra detail that will materially help.
- If the prompt is already detailed, normalize it instead of expanding it.
- For CLI fallback only, see `references/cli.md` and `references/image-api.md` for model, `quality`, `input_fidelity`, masks, output format, and output-path guidance.
- For transparent images, request actual transparency where supported and preserve its alpha.

Copy/paste specs shared by both modes: `references/sample-prompts.md`.

## Guidance by asset type
Asset-type templates (website assets, game assets, wireframes, logo) are consolidated in `references/sample-prompts.md`.

## gpt-image-2 guidance for CLI fallback

The fallback CLI defaults to `gpt-image-2`.

- For GPT Image workflows, use the selected model; `gpt-image-2` is the bundled CLI default.
- The bundled CLI reports that `gpt-image-2` does not support `background=transparent`; use a compatible model or workflow without silently replacing a user-selected model.
- `gpt-image-2` always uses high fidelity for image inputs; do not set `input_fidelity` with this model.
- `gpt-image-2` supports `quality` values `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `auto`.
- Use `quality low` for fast drafts, thumbnails, and quick iterations. Use `medium`, `high`, or `auto` for final assets, dense text, diagrams, identity-sensitive edits, or high-resolution outputs.
- Square images are typically fastest to generate. Use `1024x1024` for fast square drafts.
- If the user asks for 4K-style output, use `3840x2160` for landscape or `2160x3840` for portrait.
- `gpt-image-2` size may be `auto` or `WIDTHxHEIGHT` if all constraints hold: max edge `<= 3840px`, both edges multiples of `16px`, long-to-short ratio `<= 3:1`, total pixels between `655,360` and `8,294,400`.

Popular `gpt-image-2` sizes:
- `1024x1024` square
- `1536x1024` landscape
- `1024x1536` portrait
- `2048x2048` 2K square
- `2048x1152` 2K landscape
- `3840x2160` 4K landscape
- `2160x3840` 4K portrait
- `auto`

## Fallback CLI mode only

### Temp and output conventions
These conventions apply to the bundled CLI.
- Use `tmp/imagegen/` for intermediate files (for example JSONL batches); delete them when done.
- Write final artifacts under `output/imagegen/`.
- Use `--out` or `--out-dir` to control output paths; keep filenames stable and descriptive.

### Dependencies
Prefer `uv` for dependency management in this repo.

Required Python package:
```bash
uv pip install openai
```

Optional for image inspection and downscaling:
```bash
uv pip install pillow
```

Portability note:
- If you are using the installed skill outside this repo, install dependencies into that environment with its package manager.
- In uv-managed environments, `uv pip install ...` remains the preferred path.

### Environment
- The bundled CLI uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` and optionally `OPENAI_BASE_URL`; `generate_image` can instead use API details supplied in the conversation.
- If the selected API cannot be called with the available information, explain what is missing. Do not require the user to configure a separate image provider.

If installation is not possible in this environment, tell the user which dependency is missing and how to install it into their active environment.
